Danger: Infinite Loops!
```
i = 0
while i < 5
  puts i
  # Add your code here!
  i=i+1
  
end
```

The 'Until' Loop
```
counter = 1
until counter > 10
  puts counter
  # Add code to update 'counter' here!
  counter += 1
end
```

More Assignment Operators
 +=, -=, *=, and /=.
 
 The 'For' Loop
 ```
 for num in 1...10
  puts num
end
#1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

Inclusive and Exclusive Ranges
The reason this program counted to 9 and not 10 was that we used three dots in the range; this tells Ruby to exclude the final number in the count: for num in 1...10 means “go up to but don’t include 10.” If we use two dots, this tells Ruby to include the highest number in the range.
```
for num in 1..15
  puts num
end
# print 1 to 15 includidng
```

Building Your Own
```
for num in 1..20
   puts num
 end
 ```
