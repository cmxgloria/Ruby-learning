Creating Arrays
my_array =['apple','banana','grape']

Access by Index
We can access the ith element of an array called array by putting the index in square brackets, like so: array[i]. array[0] gets the first element, array[1] gets the second element, and so on. This is called access by index.
```
demo_array = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500]

print demo_array[2] 
```
Arrays of Non-Numbers
```
string_array = ["These", "are", "some", "strings"]
print string_array[3]
```
