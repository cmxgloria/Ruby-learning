# OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING I

## Why Classes?
Ruby is an object-oriented programming language, which means it manipulates programming constructs called objects. (Almost) everything in Ruby is an object! You’ve been using them all along, so they should be very familiar. Objects have methods, which you’ve seen before, and attributes, which are just data. For instance, in

"Matz".length
# ==> 4

```
class Language
  def initialize(name, creator)
    @name = name
    @creator = creator
  end
	
  def description
    puts "I'm #{@name} and I was created by #{@creator}!"
  end
end

ruby = Language.new("Ruby", "Yukihiro Matsumoto")
python = Language.new("Python", "Guido van Rossum")
javascript = Language.new("JavaScript", "Brendan Eich")

ruby.description
python.description
javascript.description
```
#I'm Ruby and I was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto!
I'm Python and I was created by Guido van Rossum!
I'm JavaScript and I was created by Brendan Eich!
